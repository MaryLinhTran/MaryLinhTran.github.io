    <p class="intro-stuff"> <strong>3.3.1 Magnetic Storage Media</strong> <br> <br>
        Magnetic storage media and devices store data in the form of tiny magnetised dots. 
        These dots are created, read and erased using magnetic fields created by very tiny electromagnets. 
        In the case of magnetic tape the dots are arranged along the length of a long plastic strip which 
        has been coated with a magnetisable layer (audio and video tapes use a similar technology). 
        In the case of magnetic discs (e.g. floppy disc or hard-drive), the dots are arranged in circles on 
        the surface of a plastic, metal or glass disc that has a magnetisable coating.</p>
    <p class="three-exp"> <strong>Hard-drives</strong> have a very large storage capacity (up to 1TB). They can be used to store vast amounts of data. 
        Hard-drives are random access devices and can be used to store all types of films, including huge files such 
        as movies. Data access speeds are very fast. Data is stored inside a hard-drive on rotating metal 
        or glass discs (called ‘platters’).</p>
    <p class="list-tran">Uses</p>
    <ul class="list-three">
        <li>To store the operating system , system software and working data/ files.</li> 
        <li>Storing applications that nees fast retrieval and storage of data.</li> 
        <li>Used in real-time systems (for example, robots, control of a chemical plant where data for the proccess
            is stored to allow real-time operations and in the online systems (for example booking airlines tickets
            or automatic stock control using EFTPOS, which allows immediate updating of the stock files).</li>
        <li>Used in file servers for computer networks.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p class="list-tran">Advantages</p>
    <ul class="list-three">
        <li>They have a very fast data transfer rate and fast access times to data.</li>
        <li>They have very large memory capacities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="list-tran">Disadvantages</p>
    <ul class="list-three"> 
        <li>Can be easily damaged if the correct shut down procedure is not carried out; this can lead to a head crash
            which would result in a loss of data.</li>
        <li>They have many moving parts when compared to, for example solid state drives (SSDs).</li>
        <li>Their read/ write operation can be quite noisy compared to SSDs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="three-exp">A <strong>Portable hard-drive</strong> is one that is placed into a small case along with some electronics that allow the 
        hard-drive to be accessed using a USB or similar connection. Portable hard-drives allow very large amounts
        of data to be transported from computer to computer.Many portable music players (such as the iPod classic) 
        hard-drives. These miniature devices are just not much bigger than a stamp, but can still store over 100MB of data!</p>
    <p class="list-tran">Uses</p>
    <ul class="list-three">
        <li>They can be used as backup systems to prevent loss of data.</li>
        <li>They can be used to transfer data/files/software between computers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="list-tran">Advantages</p>
    <ul class="list-three">
        <li>The data access time and data transfer rate is very fast.</li>
        <li>They have a large memory capacity.</li>
        <li>They can be used as a method of transferring infomation between computers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="list-tran">Disadvantages</p>
    <ul class="list-three">
        <li>They can be easily damaged if dropped or subjected to a strong magnetic field; as with fixed hard disk drives, 
            an incorrect shut-down procedure could also lead to loss of data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="three-exp"> <strong>Magnetic tape</strong> is a large capacity, serial access medium. Because it is a serial access medium, accessing individual files 
        on a tape is slow. Tapes are used where large amounts of data need to be stored, but where quick access to individual 
        files is not required. A typical use is for data back-up (lots of data, but rarely only accessed in an emergency).
        Tapes are also used and in some batch-processing applications (e.g. to hold the list of data that will be processed).</p>
    <p class="list-tran">Uses</p>
    <ul class="list-three">
        <li>In applications where batch processing is used, for exaple, clearing back cheques, utility billing (gas, electricity, water) 
            and producing pay slips; in these applications there is no need for any specific processing order and speed of data access is not essential.</li>
        <li>Used as a backup media since all the data needs to be stored.</li>
        <li>Used in long-term archiving of data; magnetic tapes have huge data storage capacities and are known to be very stable, which makes them 
            ideal for long term storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="list-tran">Advantages</p>
    <ul class="list-three">
        <li>They are less expensive (per byte) than the equilavent hard disk.</li>
        <li>It is very robust technology (they don't deteriorate very much over time).</li>
        <li>They have a huge data storage capacity.</li>
        <li>The data transfer rate is fast (this should  not be confused with data access time, which is very slow for 
            magnetic tapes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="list-tran">Disadvantages</p>
    <ul class="list-three">
        <li>Very slow data access times (need to read all the earlier records on the tape untill the required 
        record is foun).d</li>
        <li>When updating, another tape is needed to store the final updated version.</li>
        <li>They are affected by mangetic fields; a strong magnet can corrupt data stored on the tape.</li>

    <p class="intro-stuff"> <strong>3.3.2 Optical Storage Media</strong> <br> <br>
        Optical storage devices save data as patterns of dots that can be read using light. A laser beam is the usual light source.
        The data on the storage medium is read by bouncing the laser beam off the surface of the medium. If the beam hits a dot it
        is reflected back differently to how it would be if there were no dot. This difference can be detected, so the data can be read.
        Dots can be created using the laser beam (for media that is writable such as CD-Rs). The beam is used in a high-power mode to 
        actually mark the surface of the medium, making a dot. This process is known as ‘burning’ data onto a disc.</p>
    <div class="disk-exp">
    <p> <strong>CD-ROM & DVD-ROM</strong></p>
    <p>Compact Disc - Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) discs can hold around 800MB of data. The data cannot be altered (non-volatile), 
        so cannot be accidently deleted. CD-ROMs are random-access devices. CD-ROMs are used to distribute all sorts of data: 
        software (e.g. office applications or games), music, electronic books (e.g. an encyclopaedia with sound and video.) <br>
        Digital Versatile Disc - Read-Only Memory (DVD-ROM) discs can hold around 4.7GB of data (a dual-layer DVD can hold twice that). 
        DVD-ROMs are random-access devices. DVD-ROMs are used in the same way as CD-ROMs (see above) but, since they can hold more data, 
        they are also used to store high-quality video.</p>
    <p><em>Advantages</em> <br>
        - They hold more data than floppy disks (one CD/DVD can replace many floppy disks) <br>
        - They are less expensice than hard drive disk systems <br> <br>
        <em>Disadvantages</em> <br>
        - The data transfer rate/data access time is slower than for hard disks</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="disk-exp r">
    <p> <strong>CD-RW & DVD-RW</strong></p>
    <p>CD-ReWritable (CD-RW) and DVD-ReWritable (DVD-RW) discs, unlike CD-Rs and DVD-Rs, can have data burnt onto them and also erased 
        so that the discs can be re-used. They are used in CCTV systems and to record television programmes which can be recorded over
        time and over again. It is not as wasteful as R format as more files/data can be added to at a later state</p>
    <p><em>Advantages</em> <br>
        - Can be over written many times <br>
        - Can use different file formats each time it is used <br> <br>
        <em>Disadvantages</em> <br>
        - Can be expensive
        - It is possible to accidentally overwrite data</p>

    <div class="disk-exp">
    <p> <strong>DVD-RAM</strong></p>
    <p>DVD-Random Access Memory (DVD-RAM) discs are a type of re-writable DVD. They often come in a floppy-disc style case 
        (to protect the disc). DVD-RAM discs have a similar capacity to a normal DVD, holding 4.7GB of data. DVD-RAM discs 
        are random-access devices. DVD-RAM discs are used in many camcorders (video recording cameras). The discs are much higher 
        quality than normal DVD-RWs and can reliably store data for up to 30 years. This means that they are often used for video 
        and data back-up and archiving.</p>
    <p><em>Advantages</em> <br>
        - They have a long life (estimated 20 years minimum life) <br>
        - It is possible to do a rewrite operation over 100,000 times <br>
        - Writing on DVD-RAMs is very reliable - they have in-built verification software so the 
        accuracy of the data is ensured. <br>
        - Very fast access if the files are fairly small <br>
        - No need to finalise the disk <br>
        - Very large capacity <br>
        - They offer the ability to read data at the same time as data is being written<br> <br>
        <em>Disadvantages</em> <br>
        - Not as compatiable as R or RW format; many systems won't recognise the DVD-RAM format <br>
        - Relatively expensive <br>
        - They have been susperseded by newer technologies such as solid stat memories</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="disk-exp r-one">
        <p> <strong>CD-R & DVD-R</strong></p>
        <p>CD-Recordable (CD-R) and DVD-recordable (DVD-R) discs can have data burnt onto them, but not erased. 
        You can keep adding data until the disc is full, but you cannot remove any data or re-use a full disc.
        These CDs and DVDs are used for home recordings of music (CD-R) and films (DVD-R), and can be used
        to store data to be kept for later use or to be transferred to another computer.</p>
        <p><em>Advantages</em> <br>
        - Cheaper than RW disks<br>
        - Once burned (and finalised) they are like a ROM<br> <br>
        <em>Disadvantages</em> <br>
        - If finalised, the CD-R/DVD-R can only be recorded on once; if an error in the data has occured then the 
        disk has to be discarded since it can no longer be written to<br>
        - Not all CD/DVD players can read CD-R/DVD-R</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="disk-exp">
        <p> <strong>Blu-Ray</strong></p>
        <p>Blu-Ray disks are a recent replacement for DVDs. A Blu-Ray disc can hold 25 - 50GB of data (a dual-layer 
        Blu-Ray disc can hold twice that). Blu-Ray discs are random-access devices. Blu-Ray discs are used in the 
        same way as DVD-ROMs (see above) but, since they can hold more data, they are also used to store very high-quality, 
        high-definition (HD) video.</p>
        <p><em>Advantages</em> <br>
        - Very large storage capacity, therefore ideal for storing high definition movies<br>
        - Very fast data transfer rate<br> 
        - The data access speed is also greater than with other optical media. <br>
        - Blu-Ray discs automatically come with a secure encryption system, which helps to prevent piracy and copyright infringement <br> <br>
        <em>Disadvantages</em> <br>
        - Relatively expensive<br>
        - Encryption problems (which are used to stop piracy) when used to store video
        - There are fewer movie titles on Blu-ray format, which is reducing its impact on the home movie market</p>

    <p class="intro-stuff"> <strong>3.3.3 Solid State Storage Media</strong> <br> <br>
        The term ‘solid-state’ essentially means ‘no moving parts’. Solid-state storage devices are based on electronic circuits 
        with no moving parts (no reels of tape, no spinning discs, no laser beams, etc.) Solid-state storage devices store data 
        using a special type of memory called flash memory...</p>
    <div class="disk-exp">
    <p> <strong>Memory Sticks/ Pen Drives</strong></p>
    <p>Memory sticks (or ‘thumb-drives’) have made many other forms of portable storage almost obsolete (why burn a CD 
        or DVD when you can more easily copy your files onto a memory stick?). Memory sticks are non-volatile, random-access storage 
        devices. Each of these small devices has some flash memory connected to a USB interface. Plug it into your computer and it appears 
        as a drive. You can then add files, erase files, etc. You can use it to move any type of file between computers. Flash memory used 
        to be very expensive, but in recent years it has become much cheaper and you can now buy a 16GB memory stick for just a few dollars.</p>
    <p><em>Advantages</em> <br>
        - Very compact and portable media<br>
        - Very robust<br> 
        - Doesn't need additional software to work on most computers<br>
        - They are not affected by magnetic fields<br> <br>
        <em>Disadvantages</em> <br>
        - Can't write-protect the data/files<br>
        - Easy to lose (due to their small physical size) <br>
        - The user needs to be very careful when removing a memory stick from a computer - incorrect removal (for example,
        while it is still doing a read/write operation) will corrupt the data on the memory stick, rendering it useless </p> 
    </div>
    <div class="disk-exp r-two">
        <p> <strong>Memory Cards</strong></p>
        <p>Many of our digital devices (cameras, mobile phones, MP3 players, etc.) require compact, non-volatile data storage. 
            Flash memory cards provide this and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. One of the most common formats used by 
            digital cameras is the SD Card. The cards store the digital images taken by the camera. Mobile phones contain a 
            Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card that contains the phone’s number, the phonebook numbers, text messages, etc.
            Many phones also have extra memory cards to store music, video, photos, etc. (e.g Tiny Micro-SD cards).</p>
        <p><em>Advantages</em> <br>
            - VVery compact abd can be easily removed and used in another device or for transferring photos directly to a 
            computer or printer<br>
            - Since they are solid state memories, they are very robust<br> <br>
            <em>Disadvantages</em> <br>
            - Expensive per gigabyte of memory when compared to hard drive disks<br>
            - Have a finite life regarding the number of times they can be read from or written to<br>
            - Have a lower storage capacity than hard disks</p>
