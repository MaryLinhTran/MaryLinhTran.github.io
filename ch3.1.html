    <p class="intro-stuff"> <em>MEANING:</em> Backing up means bringing or copying data into different mediums, Such as disks, tapes, 
        flash drive and etc. Backing storage (sometimes known as secondary storage) is the name for all other data storage devices 
        in a computer: hard-drive, etc.
        Backing storage is usually non-volatile, so it is generally used to store data for a long time.</p>

    <h2>Reasons to Back Up Data</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To protect data from possibly being lost due to a failure on the secondary storage device or the hardware,
         as well as from problems with files being overwritten and corrupted.</li><br>
        <li>To protect data from hackers, one of the many actions which could occur with hackers could be that your 
        personal data could be lost or corrupted.</li><br>
        <li>To access data from elsewhere.</li><br>
        <li>However! Backups do not safeguard against viruses. A virus could be attached to a file which could 
        affect the backups as well.</li><br>
