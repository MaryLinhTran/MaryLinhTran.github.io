    <p class="intro-stuff">This section will briefly explian two main methods to access data: Serial Access & 
        Direct Access</p>
    <p class="something"><strong>3.2.1 Serial Access</strong></p>
    <p class="something"> Serial Access are files which are stored in a sequence, it will start from the beginning and search through each file one by one 
        to find the file needed. It is usually used in situations where speed is not necessary such as bank cheques. <br> <br>
        <em>Ex. Magnetic Tape, VHS, Cassette tape</em><p>
    <div id="direct-access">
    <p class="else"><strong>3.2.2 Direct Access</strong></p>
    <p class="else">Direct access are files which do not have to be sorted and searched through to find the file needed like the serial access.
        These files are accessed directly, just like the name, and they are usually used in real-time applications where speed is vital. <br> <br>
        <em>Ex. CDs, DVDs, HDDs and flash storage</em></p>

    <p>A <em>field</em> is a single piece of information.</p>
    <p>A <em>record</em> is a complete set of fields.</p>
    <p>A <em>file</em> is a collection of records.</p>

        <tr>
            <td>Field 1</td>
            <td>Field 2</td>

    <p class="files"> <strong> Master Files, Transaction Files, Key Fields </strong> (Serial Access)<br> <br>
        A Master File is when you update your original magnetic tape, meanwhile a Transaction File is another tape which contains the update. 
        The new updated tape is then referred to as the new master file, and it is vital that the records on both files are 
        in the correct order and that is the purpose for the key field.</p>

    <div id="example-file">
    <div class="table-three">
    <p id="master-file">The Master File (MF) contains the following records with key fields shown:</p> <br> <br>
    <table class="table-exp">
        <tr class="colour-row-one">
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>

            <td>4</td>

            <td>9</td>

    </table>
    <p>The Transaction File (TF) contains the following records with key fields shown:</p> <br> <br>
    <table class="table-exp">
        <tr class="colour-row-two">
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>10</td>
        </tr>
    </table class="table-exp">
    <p>The first record from each file is read. The key field both match, so the record with key 
        field 1 is written from the TF to the new master file (NMF):</p> <br> <br>
    <table class="table-exp">
        <tr>
            <td class="colour-row-two">1</td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The second record is then read from the MF and the TF; again the keys are equal so the record 
        on the TF with the kwy field 2 is now written to the NMF</p> <br> <br>
    <table class="table-exp">
        <tr>
            <td class="colour-row-two">1</td>

            <td></td>
            <td></td>

            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The third record is then read from the MF and TF; this time the key fields are different (3 and 4). 
        The MF key is smaller than the TF key, so the MF record with key 3 is now written to the NMF, then the 
        sequences continues after:</p> <br> <br>
